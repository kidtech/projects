# Circuits, Voltage Light

### Goal
This center is intended to offer a simple way to recognize a circuit and flow
of electricity while also learning about voltage.

### Preparation
* Print out the worksheet
* Tape opposing colored wires to a handful of different voltage batteries such
as AA, D, 9V, 2.5w watch, etc.
* 2.5-3v LED
* Labels for each battery

## Steps to follow

### Part 1 - Which battery is more powerful
Spread a few different types of batteries (AA, D, 9V, 2.5w watch battery, etc)
around a table with labels.  Ask which battery they think is the most powerful
and why.  Each kid should write down the battery they think will be the most
powerful.

### Part 2 - Detect Voltage
Show the kids how each battery has a positive (+) and negative (-).  Show them
how to connect the voltage detector and read the result.  Have them write the
results under each battery.

### Part 3 - Test the battery
Going from lowest voltage to highest, have the kids connect their LED to each
battery.  Have them write down which is lights up and which do not.  Do any
light up and then stop (9V)?
